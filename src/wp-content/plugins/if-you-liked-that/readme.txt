== Description ==

A simple plugin that when activated follows the content of a post with links to a user selectable number of other posts in the same category as the main post.

A number of options are given:

* You can select the heading under which the links to other posts will appear.
* You can select the number of posts to display.
* You can decide upon the way in which the links will be ordered - by title, post date or randomly.
* You can choose to show the first sentence of a post under the link to the post as a snippet of what's to come.
* Choose to show author and date of posting.
* Choose to show the links above, below or embedded within the content of the main post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I leave feedback about the If You Liked That plugin? =
Visit www.bochgoch.com

= The first sentence of my post isn't showing! =
Ensure that there is no HTML markup in the post before the first sentence. HTML confuses If You Liked That.

= My widget doesn't work =
To keep the resource overhead of this plugin low the plugin runs off the main loop. 
This means the widget must be placed in a sidebar that is displayed after the post has been sent to screen.
That usually means a sidebar that is placed on the left of the browser or in the footer, although that will vary depending on your template.
