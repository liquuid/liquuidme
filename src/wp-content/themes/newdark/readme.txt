Notes
=====

- Using basic blog functions, theme can be W3C validated in HTML5. Plugins and galleries may create some W3C errors.
CSS is already W3C validated.

- To change background or to add a logo, go to the Dashboard -> Appearance.

- Make sure to set a navigation menu after installation.

- For featured images in existing posts, you may have to download the 'Regenerate Thumbnails' plugin from WordPress.org, then run it to resize all existing thumbnails to the theme's default sizes.

- Youtube frames will be resized in widgets area however height will be set to auto. You will have to set height manually when pasting the embed code in text area e.g. height="150".  The same applies to large images as well.
